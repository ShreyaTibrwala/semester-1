<h2><center>Cooking and baking!!</center></h2>
<h3><p><center>Cooking and baking keeps me engaged and its really fun to do!</center></p></h3> 
    <h3><p><center>It's not rocket science too, what I like to do is when I'm in the mood of cooking or baking I look up for recipies online and when I find the perfect one, I make it! </center></p></h3>
    <h3><p><center>Cooking is something I can do all day!</center></p></h3>
    <h3><p><center>I personally can cook anytime I want I never turn down the offer of cooking!</center></h3>
<h3><p><center>Unlike anyother normal thing, noone has to tell me to do it, I do it out of my own will!</center></p></h3>
<h3><p><center>Many people think cooking is a waste of time but it isn't!</center></p></h3>
<h3><p><center>They also think that it's a waste of money but it is actually worth it as we get to experiment!!</center></p></h3>
<h3><p><center>Just like science, but safer! Kids can also do fireless cooking!</center></p></h3>
<h3><p><center>It is just like art, create!</center></p></h3>
